this is the operating system that these bash scripts are working:

	Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy,32-bit)
	A port of Debian Bullseye with security updates and desktop environment
	Rilasciato: 2024-10-22

the bash script has to be copied to this path:
	
	/etc/rfpi/install/LCD5_ADS7846

execute the bash script:

	sudo bash install_all.sh

the command will then run install_flows_lcd5.sh and then install_touch_lcd5.sh


OTHERS USEFUL NOTES:
Disable blank screen:
	sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
and add
	consoleblank=0
right after the rootwait
then reboot
